#  Kournas - Network Mapper

## Summary

## How to use
This program requires **zero** external libraries. All that is required to run this program is Python 3, and a decent computer as the process is quite resource heavy. To begin, open *main.py* and run it. The program determines your networks IP all by itself, all you need to do is sit back and watch the results show up.
